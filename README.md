About me paragraph

 Hello, Thank you for clicking on this page. My name is Kerim Sever and I am currently a sophomore at

        technology. My work experience has taught me value, responsibility, and management. I may not have a lot
        of work experience nor tech experience but I do my best to learn as much as possible and to one day get a
        good job at a company to expand and use my knowledge in computers and data. I hope to one day work for Amazon
        Audible and continue my career from there.
