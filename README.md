Hello,Thank you for clicking on this page. My name is Kapil Sathyakumar and I am currently a senior
        at NJIT studying Business and Information Systems. I am interested in pursing Web Development and advancing my skills in
        technology. My work experience has taught me responsibility, and management. I have a lot of
        work experience in the staffing industry but I am currently improving my tech experience but I do my best to learn as much as possible and to one day get
        a better job at a reputable company to expand and use my knowledge in computers. I hope to one day work for myself and operate my own business
        Audible and continue my career from there.
